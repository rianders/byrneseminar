  fact: The English Yew is a horticultural favorite. It is evergreen and easy to prune
    into different shapes. Most parts of this tree are poisonous, however, the chemical
    taxol was found in this genus and is currently used to treat cancer as an antitumoral
    drug!
  quizquestion: 'When a bird eats the berry-like fruit, __. '
  choices:
  - the bird gets sick
  - the seed is useless
  - the seed remains intact
  - the bird becomes immune to cancer
  answer: When a bird eats the berry-like fruit, the seed remains intact. Although
    the seeds are poisonous, the flesh of the fruit is not, so birds spread the seeds
    by eating the fruit and excreting them in their waste.
