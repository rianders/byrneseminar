  fact: This invasive deciduous tree has been introduced throughout North America
    as a street tree. It has a high tolerance for urban areas and provides a lot of
    shade.
  quizquestion: Norway Maples have been decreasing biodiversity due to the amount
    of shade they produce and __
  choices:
  - their poisonous seeds
  - the chemicals they release in the soil
  - their shallow root systems
  answer: Norway Maples have been decreasing biodiversity due to the amount of shade
    they produce and their shallow root systems. It is possible that they release
    chemicals in the soil discouraging growth of other species, but this has not been
    proven. Shallow roots make it difficult for other plants to take root.
